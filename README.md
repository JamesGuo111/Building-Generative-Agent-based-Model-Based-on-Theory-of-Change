# Building-Generative-Agent-based-Model-Based-on-Theory-of-Change

## Overview
This project is developing conceptual framework to build Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) grounded in the Theory of Change (ToC) framework to improve the evaluation policy interventions. The goal is to bridge traditional agent-based modeling with large language models (LLMs) as decision engines, enabling agents to make context-sensitive, explainable, and heterogeneous decisions while remaining embedded in a structured causal framework. To demonstrate the feasibility of the framework, a technical prototype was constructed based on a case study in the education domain, focusing on the Girls’ Education Challenge, an initiative aimed at improving educational access and outcomes for girls.

Unlike conventional ABMs that rely on fixed behavioral rules, this model equips individual agents (e.g., students, households, schools) with LLM-driven decision modules. Agents perceive their local state, institutional constraints, and intervention signals, and then generate decisions along with natural-language explanations. To ensure computational feasibility and reproducibility, all LLM decisions are cached using a structured decision cache keyed by discretized state variables.

The Theory of Change serves as the backbone of the model design. Outcomes, intermediate states, mechanisms, and assumptions are explicitly encoded into the simulation logic, allowing the model to function not only as a predictive tool but also as a mechanism-exploration and policy-evaluation framework. This structure makes it possible to analyze how micro-level decision processes aggregate into system-level outcomes under different interventions and assumptions.

The project is designed as a modular research prototype. It emphasizes transparency, extensibility, and sensitivity analysis, supporting experiments such as alternative transition rules, intervention strengths, initialization distributions, and the presence or absence of social or institutional constraints. More broadly, the project aims to demonstrate how GABM can complement traditional evaluation methods by combining causal reasoning, bounded rationality, and generative decision-making within a unified simulation framework.
